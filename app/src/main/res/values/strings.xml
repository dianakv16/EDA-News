    <string name="eda">"The School of Engineering and Digital Arts has an excellent reputation for both its teaching and research. Based in the Jennison Building on the Canterbury Campus, the School has 30 academic staff members, with both academic and industrial experience, as well as a number of specialist visiting lecturers. With strong industrial links, much of our research is supported by commercial organisations; there is also a range of industrially sponsored prizes for best students in each of our years. We are a forward-looking and culturally diverse School and our courses are regularly reviewed to ensure that they are always up-to-date."
